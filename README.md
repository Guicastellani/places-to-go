# Places to Go (Date Ideas)

This is a small web app I built for my girlfriend and me to collect, plan, and track date ideas together.
The goal was to create something fun, visual, and meaningful, while still applying good software engineering practices.

The app allows us to save date ideas, optionally assign a date, mark them as completed, and keep a shared history of moments we’ve already enjoyed.
